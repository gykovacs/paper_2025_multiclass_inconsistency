abstract = {Addressing the reproducibility crisis in artificial intelligence through the validation of reported experimental results is a challenging task. It necessitates either the reimplementation of techniques or a meticulous assessment of papers for deviations from the scientific method and best statistical practices. To facilitate the validation of reported results, we have developed numerical techniques capable of identifying inconsistencies between reported performance scores and various experimental setups in machine learning problems, including binary/multiclass classification and regression. These consistency tests are integrated into the open-source package mlscorecheck, which also provides specific test bundles designed to detect systematically recurring flaws in various fields, such as retina image processing and synthetic minority oversampling.}

@BOOK{interval,
  title     = "Introduction to interval analysis",
  author    = "Moore, Ramon E",
  abstract  = "This unique book provides an introduction to a subject whose use
               has steadily increased over the past 40 years. An update of
               Ramon Moore s previous books on the topic, it provides broad
               coverage of the subject as well as the historical perspective of
               one of the originators of modern interval analysis. The authors
               provide a hands-on introduction to INTLAB, a high-quality,
               comprehensive MATLAB toolbox for interval computations, making
               this the first interval analysis book that does with INTLAB what
               general numerical analysis texts do with MATLAB. Readers will
               find the following features of interest: elementary motivating
               examples and notes that help maximize the reader s chance of
               success in applying the techniques; exercises and hands-on
               MATLAB-based examples woven into the text; INTLAB-based examples
               and explanations integrated into the text, along with a
               comprehensive set of exercises and solutions, and an appendix
               with INTLAB commands; an extensive bibliography and appendices
               that will continue to be valuable resources once the reader is
               familiar with the subject; and a Web page with links to
               computational tools and other resources of interest. Audience:
               Introduction to Interval Analysis will be valuable to engineers
               and scientists interested in scientific computation, especially
               in reliability, effects of roundoff error, and automatic
               verification of results. The introductory material is
               particularly important for experts in global optimization and
               constraint solution algorithms. This book is suitable for
               introducing the subject to students in these areas. Contents:

Many surveys have asked scientists directly whether they have committed or know of a colleague who committed research misconduct, but their results appeared difficult to compare and synthesize. This is the first meta-analysis of these surveys. To standardize outcomes, the number of respondents who recalled at least one incident of misconduct was calculated for each question, and the analysis was limited to behaviours that distort scientific knowledge: fabrication, falsification, “cooking” of data, etc… Survey questions on plagiarism and other forms of professional misconduct were excluded. The final sample consisted of 21 surveys that were included in the systematic review, and 18 in the meta-analysis. A pooled weighted average of 1.97% (N = 7, 95%CI: 0.86–4.45) of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once –a serious form of misconduct by any standard– and up to 33.7% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behaviour of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12% (N = 12, 95% CI: 9.91–19.72) for falsification, and up to 72% for other questionable research practices. Meta-regression showed that self reports surveys, surveys using the words “falsification” or “fabrication”, and mailed surveys yielded lower percentages of misconduct. When these factors were controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by medical/pharmacological researchers than others. Considering that these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations, it appears likely that this is a conservative estimate of the true prevalence of scientific misconduct.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary
Statistical learning theory is regarded as one of the most beautifully developed branches of artificial intelligence. It provides the theoretical basis for many of today's machine learning algorithms. The theory helps to explore what permits to draw valid conclusions from empirical data. This chapter provides an overview of the key ideas and insights of statistical learning theory. The statistical learning theory begins with a class of hypotheses and uses empirical data to select one hypothesis from the class. If the data generating mechanism is benign, then it is observed that the difference between the training error and test error of a hypothesis from the class is small. The statistical learning theory generally avoids metaphysical statements about aspects of the true underlying dependency, and thus is precise by referring to the difference between training and test error. The chapter also describes some other variants of machine learning.}

abstract = {Objectives
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves show how well a risk prediction model discriminates between patients with and without a condition. We aim to investigate how ROC curves are presented in the literature and discuss and illustrate their potential limitations.
Study Design and Setting
We conducted a pragmatic literature review of contemporary publications that externally validated clinical prediction models. We illustrated limitations of ROC curves using a testicular cancer case study and simulated data.
Results
Of 86 identified prediction modeling studies, 52 (60%) presented ROC curves without thresholds and one (1%) presented an ROC curve with only a few thresholds. We illustrate that ROC curves in their standard form withhold threshold information have an unstable shape even for the same area under the curve (AUC) and are problematic for comparing model performance conditional on threshold. We compare ROC curves with classification plots, which show sensitivity and specificity conditional on risk thresholds.
Conclusion
ROC curves do not offer more information than the AUC to indicate discriminative ability. To assess the model's performance for decision-making, results should be provided conditional on risk thresholds. Therefore, if discriminatory ability must be visualized, classification plots are attractive.}

abstract = {Area under the ROC curve, a.k.a. AUC, is a measure of choice for assessing the performance of a classifier for imbalanced data. AUC maximization refers to a learning paradigm that learns a predictive model by directly maximizing its AUC score. It has been studied for more than two decades dating back to late 90s, and a huge amount of work has been devoted to AUC maximization since then. Recently, stochastic AUC maximization for big data and deep AUC maximization (DAM) for deep learning have received increasing attention and yielded dramatic impact for solving real-world problems. However, to the best our knowledge, there is no comprehensive survey of related works for AUC maximization. This article aims to address the gap by reviewing the literature in the past two decades. We not only give a holistic view of the literature but also present detailed explanations and comparisons of different papers from formulations to algorithms and theoretical guarantees. We also identify and discuss remaining and emerging issues for DAM and provide suggestions on topics for future work.},

abstract = {Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the one among other main reasons of blindness in the adult population. Early discovery of DR through screening programs and successive treatment is critical in order to avoid visual blindness. The early signs of DR as manifested in retinal images include micro-aneurysms, hemorrhages and exudates. In this paper, we have presented an ensemble classifier of bootstrapped decision trees for multiscale localization and segmentation of exudates in retinal fundus images. The candidate exudates are extracted at fine grain and coarse grain levels using morphological reconstruction and Gabor filter respectively. The contextual cues are applied to the candidate exudates, which greatly reduces false positives in exudate segmentation. Several region based features are computed from candidate regions to train the ensemble classifier for classification of pixel as exudate and non-exudate region. The method has been evaluated on four publically available databases; DIARETDB1, e-Ophtha EX, HEI-MED and Messidor. The method has achieved the segmentation accuracy as (0.8772, 0.8925, 0.9577, and 0.9836) and area under ROC as (0.9310, 0.9403, 0.9842, and 0.9961) for each of the dataset respectively. The algorithm appears to be an efficient tool for automated detection of exudates in large population based DR screening programs, due to the attained accuracy, robustness, simplicity and speed.}

abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy is a progressive eye disease which may cause blindness if not detected and treated in time. The early detection and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy is important to protect the patient's vision. The accurate detection of microaneurysms (MAs) is a critical step for early detection of diabetic retinopathy because they appear as the first sign of disease. In this paper, we propose a three-stage system for early detection of MAs using filter banks. In the first stage, the system extracts all possible candidate regions for MAs present in retinal image. In order to classify a candidate region as MA or non-MA, the system formulates a feature vector for each region depending upon certain properties, i.e. shape, color, intensity and statistics. We present a hybrid classifier which combines the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), support vector machine (SVM) and an extension of multimodel mediod based modeling approach in an ensemble to improve the accuracy of classification. The proposed system is evaluated using publicly available retinal image databases and achieved higher accuracy which is better than previously published methods.}

abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular complication of long-term diabetes and it is the major cause of visual impairment because of changes in blood vessels of the retina. Major vision loss because of DR is highly preventable with regular screening and timely intervention at the earlier stages. The presence of exudates is one of the primitive signs of DR and the detection of these exudates is the first step in automated screening for DR. Hence, exudates detection becomes a significant diagnostic task, in which digital retinal imaging plays a vital role. In this study, the authors propose an algorithm to detect the presence of exudates automatically and this helps the ophthalmologists in the diagnosis and follow-up of DR. Exudates are normally detected by their high grey-level variations and they have used an artificial neural network to perform this task by applying colour, size, shape and texture as the features. The performance of the authors algorithm has been prospectively tested by using DIARETDB1 database and evaluated by comparing the results with the ground-truth images annotated by expert ophthalmologists. They have obtained illustrative results of mean sensitivity 96.3\%, mean specificity 99.8\%, using lesion-based evaluation criterion and achieved a classification accuracy of 99.7\%.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a method for the automatic detection of exudates in digital fundus images. Our approach can be divided into three stages: candidate extraction, precise contour segmentation and the labeling of candidates as true or false exudates. For candidate detection, we borrow a grayscale morphology-based method to identify possible regions containing these bright lesions. Then, to extract the precise boundary of the candidates, we introduce a complex active contour-based method. Namely, to increase the accuracy of segmentation, we extract additional possible contours by taking advantage of the diverse behavior of different pre-processing methods. After selecting an appropriate combination of the extracted contours, a region-wise classifier is applied to remove the false exudate candidates. For this task, we consider several region-based features, and extract an appropriate feature subset to train a NaÃ¯veâ€“Bayes classifier optimized further by an adaptive boosting technique. Regarding experimental studies, the method was tested on publicly available databases both to measure the accuracy of the segmentation of exudate regions and to recognize their presence at image-level. In a proper quantitative evaluation on publicly available datasets the proposed approach outperformed several state-of-the-art exudate detector algorithms.}

We provided a method for quick model evaluations with several options: calculate the class level accuracy metrics for as many models and classes as needed; calculate model stability using random subsets of the testing data. The outputs are single calculations, summaries of the repetitions, and/or all accuracy results per repetitions. Using the application, we demonstrated the possibilities of the function and analyzed the accuracies of three experiments. We found that some popular metrics, the binary Overall Accuracy, Sensitivity, Precision, and Specificity, as well as ROC curve, can provide false results when the true negative cases dominate. F1-score, Intersection over Union and the Matthews correlation coefficient were reliable in all experiments. Medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) of the repeated sampling from the testing dataset showed that IQR were small when a model was almost perfect or completely unacceptable; thus, IQR reflected the model stability, reproducibility. We found that there were no general, statistically justified relationship with the median and IQR, furthermore, correlations of accuracy metrics varied by experiments, too. Accordingly, a multi-metric evaluation is suggested instead of a single metric.}

abstract = {Assessing the classification performance of ordinal classifiers is a challenging problem under imbalanced data compositions. Considering the critical impact of the metrics on the choice of classifiers, employing a metric with the highest performance is crucial. Although Cohen’s kappa measure is used for performance assessment, there are better-performing agreement measures under different formations of ordinal confusion matrices. This research implements weighted agreement measures as evaluation metrics for ordinal classifiers. The applicability of agreement and mainstream performance metrics to various practice fields under challenging data compositions is assessed. The sensitivity of the metrics in detecting subtle distinctions between ordinal classifiers is analyzed. Five kappa-like agreement measures with six weighting schemes are employed as evaluation metrics. Their reliability/usefulness is compared to the mainstream and recently proposed metrics, including F1, Matthews correlation coefficient, and informational agreement. The performance of 37 metrics is analyzed in two extensive numerical studies, including synthetic confusion matrices and real datasets. Promising metrics under practical circumstances are identified, and recommendations about the best metric to evaluate ordinal classifiers under different conditions are made. Overall, the weighted Scott’s pi-measure is found useful, sensitive to small differences in the classification performance, and reliable under general conditions.}

abstract = {The imbalanced learning issue is related to the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of asymmetrical class distribution. Due to the complex characteristics of imbalanced datasets, learning from such data need new algorithms and understandings to convert efficient large amounts of initial data into suitable datasets. Although several review papers can be found about imbalanced classification problems, none of them contributed an in-depth review of SVM for imbalanced classification problems. To fill this gap, we present an exhaustive review of existing methods to deal with issues linked with class imbalance learning. The majority of the existing survey addresses only classification tasks. We also describe methods to deal with similar problems in regression tasks. A new taxonomy for class imbalanced learning techniques is proposed and classified into three parts: (1) Data pre-processing, (2) Algorithmic structures, and (3) Hybrid techniques. The advantages and disadvantages of each type of imbalanced learning technique are discussed. Moreover, we explain the main difficulties in distributions of imbalanced datasets and discuss the main approaches that have been proposed to tackle these issues. Finally, to stimulate the next research in this area, we emphasize the main opportunities and challenges, which can be useful in research directions for learning algorithms from imbalanced data.}
