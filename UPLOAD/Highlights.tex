\begin{itemize}
\item For performance scores calculated directly from confusion matrices, we introduce a consistency test that supports 20 of the most commonly used scores. 
\item For experimental setups that involve the averaging of performance scores across dataset folds or multiple datasets, we propose a consistency test that supports four widely used scores: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy.
\item We illustrate the practical application of the proposed techniques in three real-world problems. 
\item To benefit the research community, we have released the proposed tests as part of the open-source Python package \verb|mlscorecheck|.
